Python Importance
=================
- simple syntax, and english like language
- readable by, even, non-programmers
- Supports 3 programming paradigms
	- Aspect oriented - like how is write sequentially, and
	- Functional oriented, and
	- Object oriented
- Though we may not create classes, all time, but is called object oriented programming, as all variables/functions are treated as objects, in Python.
- Open sources and has a lot of modules, ranging from astronomy, till biotechnology

python 2 vs 3
=============
- In python2, default encoding is ascii, whereas in Python 3, default is utf-8
- In python2, dictionaries are unordered, whereas from python 3.6, dictionaries will retain the assigned order.
- Python 2 suports both old style classes and new style classes when inheriting object; whereas python3 supports only new-style classes.
- In python2, range, map, filter will return list; where these are iterators in python3.
- For range,
	In python 2,
		- range will give list of integers
		- xrange will give a xrange object, which will give values only when iterated.
	- In python3,
		- xrange is renamed as range.
		- so, it results in range data type, with lazy or on-demand loading

python 2 to 3 conversion
========================
- I used python built-in module, lib2to3 , for migrating from python2 to python3.
- Wrote code with six module to write compatible code, for both python2 and 3, during migrating phase.
- Challenges during conversion
	- In python2, we can compare string and int; We cant do the same with python3
		- I wrote wrapper to handle it
	- DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT is another difficult thing, as some modules are either not available in python3,
		or the latest features are not available in python3 modules.

Python Questions
================
- Basic Data Types - Int, Float, Str, None, bool
- Built-in Data Structures - List, Tuple, set, Dictionary

- List
	- Mutable object - it is editable. we can add, remove any element in it.
	- indexed and retains the order of initialization
	- will retain duplicates and can store any data type

- Tuple
	- same as a list, but once created, we can't change any element in it .
	- it is immutable object

- Set
	- mutable object - we can edit it
	- unordered and wont store duplicates
	- will store only immutable objects(int, float, string, frozenset, tuple)
	- frozenset is same like set, but is immutable

- Dictionaries
	- They store in key: value relation
	- keys should be immutable and unique, and hashable
	- Values can be mutable
	- They are called as HashMap in other languages
	- ex: {1:2, 3:4, 5:6}

- conclusions
	- List is suitable when the order of storage is needed and/or
	  if there were more writes.
	- Dict suitable when there were more reads
	- Set is suitable when unique values are needed and/or set operations like union,
	  intersection, etc are needed.
	- Tuple is suitable when there need to be immutability

- mutable vs immutable
	Any object that supports changes on itself, is mutable object; else an immutable object.
	Examples of mutable objects include list, set, dictionary
	Examples of immutable objects include tuple, frozenset, basic data types, class with __slot__ defined

- hashable
	- An object is hashable if it has a hash value which never changes during its lifetime

- List vs Tuple
	- List is mutable object, means we can edit the object like append, delete, ..
	- Tuple are faster than list
		- Tuples are stored in a single block of memory. Tuples are immutable so,
		It doesn't require extra space to store new objects.
		- Lists are allocated in two blocks:
			1. fixed one with all the Python object information, and
			2. variable sized block for the data.
	- Tuples is that they use less memory where lists use more memory
	- USAGE:
		List is used when we need to make changes in code, say adding values while loop .
		Tuple is used when we wont change something in the code

- append vs extend
	- both adding elements in last of list
	- with append, we can add either single element or an iterable
	- it will add at the end as it is
	- whereas extend works with iterable objects only, but adds in same dimension

- Slicing
	- slicing works on any iterable and indexable object, like list, tuple, str, etc.
	- syntax is in square braces,
			[startIndex, endIndex, step]
	- It will result in all elements from startIndex, till the endIndex, on counts of the given step
	- Default
		step is +1
		startIndex is 0
		endIndex is end of length

- List vs Dict
	- list is suitable when the order of elements is preferred.
	- dict is suitable when there were more reads. dict has O(1) for search an element, as
	  it stored each element uniquely with its hash.
	- Insertion time is less in list

- list.sort vs sorted
	- List.sort – will do inplace sorting. So, changes will be made on the list itself.
	- sorted() function will created a new sorted list. So, existing list will not change.

- range vs xrange
	- xrange of python2, is renamed as range in python 3
	- range in python2 results a list, whereas in python 3, range results in range object.
	- range takes three arguments - start number, stopNumber and step ;
	  then, will return the sequence for those values

- Pickling
	- Pickling means Python object to flat file conversion
	- unpickling means flat file to python object conversion
	- This process is also called serialization/deserialization
	- Other serialization formats are json, yaml, ...
	- we use it when we need to pass python object to other language processes, and vice versa.

	json.dumps for converting python string to JSON string
	json.dump  for converting python string to JSON file

	json.loads for loading JSON string to python string
	json.load  for loading JSON string to python file

- lambda function
	- one liner function, mainly useful for evaluating a single expression that is supposed to be evaluated only once.
	- SYNTAX is lambda arguments: expression
	- We need not define a complete function. We can use it instantly for the purpose.
	- It can be passed as a parameter to a higher-order function, like filter(), map(), and reduce().
	- example
		- if we have to increment all values in a list by one,
				map(lambda x:x + 1, range(10))
	- And, coming to the con side,
		- It can’t perform multiple expressions.
		- It can easily become cumbersome, for example when it includes an if-elif-…-else cycle.
		- It can’t contain any variable assignments (e.g., lambda x: x=0 will throw a SyntaxError).
		- We can’t provide a docstring to a lambda function.

- enumerate
	- Its a build-in function, mainly used when iterating over any iterable,
	  to get the loop index.
	 - ex: say we are looping with for loop, over a string, and we need loop index too,
			for index, char in mystr:
				print(index, char)

- List comprehension
	- rewriting the for loop in a single line.
	- As it creates a code object, it will be slightly faster.
	- But, comprehension will reduce the readability of code.
	- Based on the braces we store with, comprehensions include
		- list comprehension
		- set comprehension
		- dictionary comprehension
		- Tuple comprehension is called generator expression

- *args vs **kwargs(args vs kwargs)
	- They are used for creating variadic functions.
	- *args will enable a function to take zero or any number of arguments.
	  It will store all the values in a tuple

	- **kwargs will enable the function to take any number of keyword arguments.
	  It will store all values in a dictionary.
	  Ex: func(a=1, b=2, c=3)  will create a dict {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

constructor
	- its the method, which will be called, automatically, when we
	  instantiate the class instance
	  __init__() is the method for the same

destructor
	- its the method, which will be called, automatically, when we
	  delete an instance, or at the end of scope of the instance.
	  __del__() is the method for the same


overloading vs overwriting
	- If we define two functions/methods with same name, but different no. of arguments,
	  then, if we can call both functions/methods individually, it is called Overloading.

	- Python does not support overloading, but only overwriting is supported
	- Overwriting means among the defined two functions, as both have same name,
	  the latest defined function/method will overwrite others.

subprocess popen vs run
	- with subprocess.run and os.system, we can run any command, and get result as
		0 if command executed successfully
		1 if command FAILED
	- with subprocess.popen, we can capture both output and error

- range() vs xrange()
	- In python 2,
		- range will give list of integers
		- xrange will give a xrange object, which will give values only when iterated.
		- Means, xrange is lazy loading object.
	- In python3, xrange is renamed as range.

- copy vs deepcopy / Shallow vs Deep copy
	- This problem occurs in mutable objects i.e., list, dictionary
	- when working with mutables, when we assign a
			list1 = list2
		It will not create new object, but both will refer to the same object.
		So, if you change in one list, it will reflect in others too.
		To avoid this leakage, I used copy module

	- Shallow copy is used for single dimension mutable objects
	- Deep copy is used for multiple dimension mutable objects

	- Reason:
		when we do assignments of mutable objects, say like,
			mylist2 = mylist1
		Then, if we make changes of one of them, the others will also be affected.
		So, we use copy module to safely copy.
		Shallow copy or soft copy will also have leakages for multi-dimensional mutable objects.
		so, conclusion is that
			shallow/soft copy need to used for single dimension mutable objects, as it is faster.
			Deep copy need for multi-dimensional mutable objects.

- try-exception blocks
	1) Try   --- executed every time
	2) Except--- executed when there is exception in try block,
				 check if it can handle break code if it cant

	3) Else  --- executed when no exception in try block
	4) Finally-- executed every time  — irrespective of failure  –
				 it is like for file closing, etc ….

- Debugging in python
	- Either using pdb or ipdb modules, or using breakpoint() function

- error vs exception
	- errors are fatal problems that cannot be handled by the program, while
	- exceptions are non-fatal problems that can be handled by the program

	- error
		- An error is a problem that occurs at runtime and causes the program to terminate abnormally.
		- Errors are typically caused by problems with
			- system resources, such as memory allocation errors or file I/O errors, or
			- by programming errors, such as dividing by zero or accessing an array out of bounds.
		- Errors are usually fatal and cannot be handled by the program.

	- exception
		- is a problem that occurs at runtime, but can be handled by the program.
		- Exceptions are typically caused by
			- errors in program logic, such as attempting to open a file that does not exist, or
			- by unexpected input or conditions.
		- When an exception occurs, the program stops executing the current function and looks for an exception handler that can handle the exception.
		- If no handler is found, the program terminates with an error.

- oop (object Oriented Programming)
	- I use Object-Oriented Programming and Design predominantly.
	- It gives us the scalability in code to adapt any requirement changes.

	- There are 4 principles:
	1) ENCAPSULATION
		- Encapsulation is used to restrict access to methods and variables.
		- In encapsulation, code and data are wrapped together within a single unit from being modified by accident.
		- with public, protected and private variables/methods
			public variable -- it a variable is starting with no underscore
			protected variable -- if it is starting with SINGLE underscore
			private variable -- if it is starting  with TWO underscores

		We can access all variables  of all classes irrespective of public or private or protected.
		This name mangling is to avoid accidental override

	2) ABSTRACTION:
		- It is defined as a process of hiding implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
		- It is defined as a process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user.

	3) INHERITANCE:
		- python supports single, multiple and multi-level inheritance, using MRO (Method Resolution Order)
				single ---> one parent & one child
				multiple --> two parents & one child
				multi-level -->  parent1 => child ==> subChild
		- Method Resolution Order is the order in which base classes are searched for a member during lookup.
		  hybrid & hierarchical

	4) POLYMORPHISM: It is an ability of object to behave in multiple form.
		- For better code resusability, common code we write in one class, and inherint in other classes.
		- Python supp

		Ex: + operator, It will work differently in different contexts
				addition operation between integers
				List concatenation operator between lists
				Tuple concatenation operator between tuples

- self
	- It is the first argument in instance methods.
	- Its the placeholder for the instance being passed to the class
	- It is not a keyword, but PEP 8 recommends as everyone is using, for uniformity

- class variables vs instance variables
	- Class variable is used to work with class methods
	- Instance variables are just associated with instance methods

	- Say, we have created  5 instances  from a car class
	  We need to give unique id to all the car instances,
	  Then, We can track using the class variables
	- Instance variables of each instance, will be isolated
	  from that of other instances.

- class method vs static method
	- Methods are of three types
		1) Instance Methods have self as first argument, and use instance variables/methods in it.
		2) Class Methods have cls as first argument, and use class variables/methods in it.
		3) Static Methods use neither class nor instance variables/methods. It is like a utility method.

	- cls is not keyword yet, but recently self is declared as a keyword in python 3.11.
	  - yet, it is best practice to use only them, by PEP8

	- staticmethods are mainly used for utiity functions

- function vs method
	- methods are defined in a namespace of a class; so associated with that class.
	- functions are defined independently

- Abstract Classes
	- These are called as blueprint for other classes
	- These classes are used for inheritance only, and not for creating instances.

- Virtual environment
	- It is like a container, for isolating the project dependencies
	- When in same server, we need to execute different versions, Or same python version, with different module
		versions, we go with a virtual environment.
	- virtual environments can be created using modules like
		- virtualenv
		- pipenv, or
		- poerty

	- Using virtualenv module,
		command to create virtual enviromment is
			virtualenv venv

		To activate the virtual enviromment,
			venv/scripts/active - in windows
			venv/bin/active - in linux/mac

- .py vs .pyc files
	❏ .py files contain the source code of a program. Whereas, .pyc file contains the bytecode of your
	program.
	❏ Python compiles the .py files and saves it as .pyc files, so it can reference them in subsequent
	invocations.
	❏ The .pyc contain the compiled bytecode of Python source files. This code is then executed by
	Python's virtual machine.

- Generators
	- are the functions with yield, instead of return
	- They are useful for large computations, like reading a large file, or creating 1000 prime numbers, or so.
	- Generators follow the "STATE SUSPENSION"
		- we can get one value at a time using next() builtin function,
			or iterate , or convert to list, tuple or set, to get all values
	- return vs yield
		- return is the last statement to execute in any function
		- yield is a keyword in python
			- If yield is placed within function definition, it becomes generator

		- PEP8 - don't use both return & yield in same function

	- what happens if return is placed in generator?
	- Ans) It wont throw error. But when all values were iterated from it, for the last iteration, the return value will come as stop iteration exception message.

- Iterator
	- Any python iterable object can be converted to an intertor using iter() protocol
	- iterator can be created from any iterable object

- Decorators
	- Generally, when some code is repeating, we will create a function, reuse the code.
	- If there were more than one function, with some part of the code which is common among all,
      in that case, we extract common code, create a closure for it, and use it as a decorator.
	- built-in decorators are classmethod, staticmethod and property
	- I created custom decorators for calculating the time taken by functions, or
	  like logging the events, etc
	Advantage - better code reusability
	No performance change, as same code lines will execute

- decorator wraps
	- Decorators are the function which takes another functions as arguments.
	- The docstrings of the orginal function which is being passed into decorator function will be lost.
	- functools.wraps decorator on the inner function, of decorator, will help retain those docstrings.

- Map
	- Higher-order function, which is designed to work on other functions
	- map will superimpose a function on one or more iterables
	- say, we want to get double of all values in a list
		map(lambda x:x * 2, range(9))

	- In python2, map will result a list, where as in python3, it will return an iterator object.
	- Other higher order functions are Filter, Zip and Reduce

- Filter
	- This higher-order function will superimpose a function, on one or more iterables
	  and return the values, for whom the function returns boolean true.

- Zip
	- It will create pairs, on two or more iterables.
	- It will create pairs to the minimum size, among the iterables;
	  and discard asymmetric size values.

- Reduce
	- It will iterate on a single iterable with the given function
	- It will take a function and work with every two consecutive elements in that iterable
	- Finally, returns a single value as result.
	-  Ex: for calculating factorial of a number, etc.
	- Its a build-in function in python2, whereas in python 3, it is part of functools module

- pass, continue and break
	- pass is like a TODO. It does nothing, except to hold the syntax
	- say we need to have a class, or a condition, but want to write logic in future,
	  we use "pass" to retain the syntax.

	- continue will skip the current loop, whereas
	  break will stop the entire loop

- race condition
	- A race condition occurs when two or more threads can access shared data and they try to change it at the same time.
	- Because the thread scheduling algorithm can swap between threads at any time, you don't know the order in which the threads will attempt to access the shared data.

- GIL Problem
	- GIL means Global Interpreter Lock
	- Simply, it means "One thread runs Python, while others sleep or await I/O."

	- In Cpython, as it goes with reference based assignment, if two threads are trying to update,
	  say, the same list, it can lead to data races, and deadlock.
	- To avoid deadlocks, it will lock a single thread, safely execute it, and release it.
	- Due to this, we can't achieve concurrency with python, unlike other languages.

	- Next solution is multiprocessing. But, it is resource exhaustive. And, the maximum limit
	 on the processes which can be created, is limited to the system hardware limits.
	- So, from python 3.6, with the advent of async and await keywords, I am using the asyncio
	 based non-blocking execution.
	- Here, within the single thread event loop, we will invoke all child threads; which is a solution
	  to this GIL problem

- Multiprocessing vs Multithreading
	- Tasks are of two types
	- Multithreading for IO-bound tasks.
	- Multiprocessing for CPU-bound tasks.
		- computationally-intensive tasks such as compression or hashing.

- Multithreading in Python
	- I Used multithreading module for it.

	- first, create all the threads
	- then, start all these threads
	- Finally, join all these threads, such that it will ensure to go to next step, after all were done.

- Asyncio
	- Asyncio allows us to run IO-bound tasks asynchronously to increase the performance of our program.
	- Common IO-bound tasks include, like,
		- calls to a database,
		- reading and writing files to disk, and
		- sending and receiving HTTP requests.

- Threading vs Asyncio
	Threading
		- In threading, OS actually knows about each thread and can interrupt it at
			any time to start running a different thread.
		- It is Preemptive Multitasking
		- code in the thread doesn't need to do anything to make the switch.
		- difficult as OS can pause/resume thread "AT ANY TIME"
	Asyncio
		- Cooperative Multitasking
		- Tasks must cooperate by announcing when they are ready to be switched out.
		- You always know where your task will be swapped out.
		- Suitable for event-driven architectures

process vs thread
	- processes do not share memory and run on a single core.
	  They are better for compute-intensive tasks that do not have to communicate with each other.
	- threads share memory.
	  In Python, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), two threads cannot operate
	  at the same time in the same program.
	  As a result, only some operations can be run in parallel using threads.

	- A process is just an instance of an executing program.
		A thread, on the other hand, is like a mini process.
	Each process typically has 1 thread of control, but in several situations, it is beneficial to have multiple threads of control in the same process.


- thread vs process
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		PROCESS								    |			THREAD
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- Processes are heavyweight operations.	    | Threads are lighter weight operations.
	- Each process has its own memory space.    | Threads use the memory of the process they belong to.
	- Inter-process communication is slow as    | Inter-thread communication can be faster than inter-process communication
	  processes have different memory addresses.| because threads of the same process share memory with the process they belong to.
	- Context switching between processes is    | Context switching between threads of the same process is less expensive
	  more expensive.
	- Processes don’t share memory with other   | Threads share memory with other threads of the same process.
	  processes.

- thread life cycle
	- Every thread will have FIVE stages.
		1) New - when thread is created, and yet to start
		2) Active  - when invoked with start() method
					- within it, there are two substates
						a) runnable - Means it is about to run, when thread scheduler gives time.
						b) running - Means when thread gets CPU, it will run, and then moves to runnable state again.
		3) Blocked / Waiting - when ever thread is inactive for sometime, temporarily
		4) Timed Waiting - means sometimes, waiting for leads to starvation; say to prioritize another thread.
		5) Terminated - Either when thread finighes its job, or abnormal termination like unhandled exception, etc.


concurrency vs parallelism
 - “Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once.
    Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once”

- cooperative multitasking
	- Whenever a thread begins sleeping or awaiting network I/O, there is a chance for
	  another thread to take the GIL and execute Python code.

- preemptive multitasking
	- CPython has it. Something similar to time slicing
	- If a thread runs uninterrupted for 1000 bytecode instructions in Python 2, or runs
	  15 milliseconds(set via sys.setswitchinterval()) in Python 3, then it gives up
	  the GIL and another thread may run.

- Thread Pooling
	- Assiging a bunch of threads, and reusing them, instead of creating a new thread.
	- The pool is responsible for a fixed number of threads.
		- It controls when the threads are created, such as just-in-time when they are needed.
		- It also controls what threads should do when they are not being used, such as making them wait without consuming computational resources.

- Thread Safety
	- If a thead loses GIL at any moment, we should ensure that code is thread safe.
	- Many Python operations like sort(), ... are atomic.
	- GIL wont switch in middle of automatic operations.
	- EX: A thread cannot be interrupted in the middle of sorting, and other threads never
	      see a partly sorted list, nor see stale data from before the list was sorted.

	- Locks are needed to protect shared mutable state

Atomic Operations
	- All  single bytecode instruction. We can checking using dis module; dis.dis(object)
	- Assuming L, L1, L2 are lists, D, D1, D2 are dicts, x, y are objects, i, j are ints,

	L.append(x)
	L1.extend(L2)
	x = L[i]
	x = L.pop()
	L1[i:j] = L2
	L.sort()
	x = y
	x.field = y
	D[x] = y
	D1.update(D2)
	D.keys()

PYTHONPATH
	- It is an environment variable that you set before running the Python interpreter.
	- PYTHONPATH, if it exists, should contain directories that should be searched for modules when using import.
	- If PYTHONPATH is set, Python will include the directories in sys.

	- It is a special environment variable that tells Python interpreter about where to find various libraries and applications.

Non-Automic Operations
	i = i+1
	L.append(L[-1])
	L[i] = L[j]
	D[x] = D[x] + 1

- context managers
	- will allow you to allocate and release resources precisely when you want to.
	- Examples include when working with
		- file operations, database or socket connections, etc.
	- They implement the "finally" block once we come out of the context manager indentation.

	- we can do with the 'with' keyword, like

		with open('file_name.txt', 'r') as fh:
			data = fh.read()

	- we need not close the file handler. Once it comes out of the context indentation,
	  it will automatically close
I	- we can create custom context managers, using the dunder methods,
      __enter__() and __exit__().
	- I remember using it to track the file operations.

		class File:
		  def __init__(self, filename, method):
			self.file = open(filename, method)

		  def __enter__(self):
			print("Enter")
			return self.file

		  def __exit__(self, type, value, traceback):
			print(f"{type}, {value}, {traceback}")
			print("Exit")
			self.file.close()

		with File("file.txt", "w") as f:
		  print("Middle")
		  f.write("hello")
		  raise Exception()
		  raise FileExistsEoor()

- call by value vs call by reference
	- python supports both call by value and call by reference.

	- call by value means changes within functions, on variables, should not reflect outside.
	- call by reference means changes with functions, on variables, should REFLECT outside.

	- For immutables,
		- By default, it is call by value.
		- To make as call by reference, we need to define as global variables, to reflect local changes, outside.
	- For mutables,
		- By default, it is call by reference.
		- To avoid local changes, from reflecting outside, we need to do changes on copied objects.


- descriptors
	Descriptors are used to transform access object properties into call descriptor methods.
	The __get__() method is called when the attribute is accessed for reading.
	The __set__() method is called when the attribute is assigned a value.
	The __delete__() method is called when the attribute is deleted.

	Descriptors are typically used to define properties in a class, but they can also be used to define methods.

	USECASE:
	Consider an email attribute. Verification of the correct email format is necessary before assigning a value to that attribute. This descriptor allows email to be processed through a regular expression and its format validated before assigning it to an attribute.


__getattribute__ vs__getattr__
	__getattribute__ will intercept EVERY attribute lookup, doesn’t matter if the attribute exists or not.


- name mangling
	- python supports Public, private and protected variables/methods/functions
	- We can access even private variables, methods too  in python,
		But the convention is made to avoid accidental override

	- Variable starting with no _underscores are called public variables
	- Variables starting with single underscore are called protected variables
	- variables starting with two underscores are called private variables
		- Also, variables starting with two underscores and ending with two underscores
		  are magic methods (or dunder/double underscore methods, or special methods).
		- Ex: __init__ is the constructor
			  __del__ is the destructor
			  __enter__ and __exit__ are used for creating custom context managers
			  __iter__ and __next__ are used for creating Iterator objects
			  __str__ and __repr__ are used for string representation of the instances

- logging

  log levels
	Debug
	Info
	Warning
	Error
	Critical

  log levels can be set either in basic config, or in the log object.


- Monkey patching is replacing a function/method/class by another at runtime,
   for testing purpses, fixing a bug or otherwise changing behaviour.

	Usage:
		monkeytype run <file>.py  dumps function call traces into SQLite databse
		monkeytype stub <module>.py outputs preview of annotated code
		monkeytype apply <module>.py applies the annotated code to the file

- namespaces
	LEGB - Local, Enclosed, Global, Builtin scopes

- py vs pyc
	- py extension files are ordinary python files
	- pyc extension files are python bytecode files,

- PEP 8
	- PEP is abbreviation for Python Enhancement Proposal
	- It deals with the coding style guide
	- It will list the best practices, in coding in python
	- These recommendations include
		- to use 4 spaces, and not tabs , for indentation
		- Use triple quotes for docstrings
		- Wrap lines so that they don’t exceed 79 characters, in each line
		- class names should in camel casing, and all others should be in underscore casing
		- Use Python’s default UTF-8 or ASCII encodings and not any fancy encodings
		- Blank Lines
			- Two blank lines should be both before and after class/method/function definitions.
			- You should use blank lines conservatively within your code to separate groups of functions.
		- One space around the operators
		- Wildcard imports (*) should not be preferred
		- Avoid trailing white-spaces

- Memory Management in python
	- Python has automatic memory management, based on garbage collector.
	- cpython uses reference counting to detect inaccessible objects, and another mechanism to collect reference cycles,
	  periodically executing a cycle detection algorithm which looks for inaccessible cycles and deletes the objects involved.
	- We have a garbage collector, which will check for any unreferenced objects
	  on a periodically, for each CPU clock cycle, and it will delete them.

	- Reference count is the number of references to an object.
	  When the reference count of an object drops to zero, it is deallocated.

	- we can check the reference count of any value using the sys module, sys.getreferencecount
	- The garbage collector can be controlled using the gc module.

- stack & heap
	- each thread will have its own stack, but all the threads in a process will share
	  the heap.

Heap vs stack
--------------
- Whenever an object is created, it’s always stored in the Heap space, and stack memory contains the reference to it.
- Stack memory only contains local primitive variables and reference variables to objects in heap space.
- Objects stored in the heap are globally accessible whereas stack memory can’t be accessed by other threads.
- Memory management in stack is done in LIFO manner whereas it’s more complex in Heap memory because it’s used globally.
- Stack memory is short-lived whereas heap memory lives from the start till the	end of application execution.
- Heap memory is used by all the parts of the application, stack memory is used	only by one thread of execution.
- When stack memory is full, Java runtime throws java.lang.StackOverFlowError
  When heap memory is full, it throws java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java Heap Space error.
- Stack memory is faster than heap memory.

global variables in python
- I will Enum for storing the global variables.
- I will segrgate them based on the usage.
- will store them in __init__.py file, and load at the package level.


- static class vs singleton
---------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Singleton Pattern														Static Class
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Singleton is a design pattern.										Static classes are basically a way of grouping classes together in Java.
2) Memory is allocated once the object is created.						Memory is allocated immediately after any of the class members is accessed.
3) Singleton implementation can either have static members or instance members.	Static classes can contain static members only.
4) It can implement any other interface or base class is required.		It cannot implement the interface or any other base class.
5) Singleton classes can be used as a method parameter.	Static class cannot be used as a method parameter.
6) Singleton pattern uses Heap memory.	Static classes use stack memory.
7) It works within the scope of Garbage Collector as it uses Heap memory.	Out of scope for Garbage Collector as it uses stack memory.
8) It supports Dependency Injection (DI) implementation as Singleton follows OOPS concepts.	It cannot implement Dependency Injection (DI) as DI is Interface-driven.
9) Singleton is an architectural pattern and not a language feature.	Static is a language feature and not an Architectural pattern.
10) Disposal of objects is possible.									It cannot dispose of the static class as there is no instance created.


Python secure coding best practices
===================================
	1) Always sanitize external data
		- to avoid injctions, cross-side scripting, or Denial of Service(DoS) attacks
	2) Scan your code
		- linting with flake8, etc
		- scanning with bandit, etc
	3) Be careful when downloading packages
		- To avoid typesquatting (mean malicious packages with similar name of legitimate packages)
	4) Review your dependency licenses
	5) Do not use the system standard version of Python
	6) Use Python’s capability for virtual environments
	7) Set DEBUG = False in production
	8) Be careful with string formatting
	9) (De)serialize very cautiously
		- using SafeLoader option, instead of Loader, when loading json, yaml, pickle, etc.
		- This prevents loading of custom classes but supports standard types like hashes and arrays.
	10)Use Python type annotations
		- as it will prevent most of runtime errors.

Python code performance optimization
------------------------------------
	1) Use built-in functions and libraries: Python has a lot of built-in functions and libraries that are optimized for performance. Using them can often be much faster than writing your own code.
	2) Use list comprehensions and generators: List comprehensions and generators are more efficient than using loops, especially when dealing with large data sets.
	3) Use profiling: Profiling can help identify performance bottlenecks in your code. The Python standard library includes the cProfile module, which can be used to profile code.
	4) Parallelize your code: Python has a number of libraries for parallel processing, such as multiprocessing and threading. Parallelizing your code can help improve performance on multi-core systems.
	5) Use caching: If a function is called repeatedly with the same arguments, consider caching the result to avoid repeating the same calculation.
	6) Avoid unnecessary function calls: Function calls in Python are relatively expensive. Avoid calling functions unnecessarily, especially in loops.
	7) Use appropriate data structures: Choosing the right data structure can significantly improve performance. For example, using sets instead of lists can improve performance when dealing with membership testing.
	8) Use NumPy for numerical calculations: NumPy is a library for numerical calculations that is optimized for performance. Using NumPy can be much faster than using Python's built-in data types.
	9) Consider using a JIT compiler: A JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler can significantly improve the performance of Python code. Libraries such as Numba and PyPy include JIT compilers.

	conclusion - There are many techniques; but performance can sometimes come at the cost of readability and maintainability.
		ex: List comprehension is fast, compared to ordinary for loop; but at the cost of readability.

Loops - Performance
===================
In General, there are three types of loops
	1) while loop will always evaluates the condition first
	2) do/while loop will always execute the code in the do{} block first and then evaluate the condition.
	3) for loop allows to initiate a counter variable, a check condition, and a way to increment your counter all in one line.

	while is faster, as for loop need to compute the limits, before starting the loop.


Metaclasses
-----------
	- A metaclass is the class of a class.
	- A class defines how an instance of the class (i.e. an object) behaves
		while a metaclass defines how a class behaves. A class is an instance of a metaclass.

	While in Python you can use arbitrary callables for metaclasses, the better approach is
	to make it an actual class itself.
	type is the usual metaclass in Python.
	type is itself a class, and it is its own type.
	You won't be able to recreate something like type purely in Python, but Python cheats
	a little. To create your own metaclass in Python you really just want to subclass type.

	A metaclass is most commonly used as a class-factory. When you create an object
	by calling the class, Python creates a new class (when it executes the 'class' statement)
	by calling the metaclass.
	Combined with the normal __init__ and __new__ methods, metaclasses therefore allow you to
	do 'extra things' when creating a class, like registering the new class with some registry or replace the class with something else entirely.

	When the class statement is executed, Python first executes the body of the class statement as a normal block of code. The resulting namespace (a dict) holds the attributes of the class-to-be. The metaclass is determined by looking at the baseclasses of the class-to-be (metaclasses are inherited), at the __metaclass__ attribute of the class-to-be (if any) or the __metaclass__ global variable. The metaclass is then called with the name, bases and attributes of the class to instantiate it.

	However, metaclasses actually define the type of a class, not just a factory for it, so you can do much more with them. You can, for instance, define normal methods on the metaclass. These metaclass-methods are like classmethods in that they can be called on the class without an instance, but they are also not like classmethods in that they cannot be called on an instance of the class. type.__subclasses__() is an example of a method on the type metaclass. You can also define the normal 'magic' methods, like __add__, __iter__ and __getattr__, to implement or change how the class behaves.

	Here's an aggregated example of the bits and pieces:

	def make_hook(f):
		"""Decorator to turn 'foo' method into '__foo__'"""
		f.is_hook = 1
		return f

	class MyType(type):
		def __new__(mcls, name, bases, attrs):

			if name.startswith('None'):
				return None

			# Go over attributes and see if they should be renamed.
			newattrs = {}
			for attrname, attrvalue in attrs.iteritems():
				if getattr(attrvalue, 'is_hook', 0):
					newattrs['__%s__' % attrname] = attrvalue
				else:
					newattrs[attrname] = attrvalue

			return super(MyType, mcls).__new__(mcls, name, bases, newattrs)

		def __init__(self, name, bases, attrs):
			super(MyType, self).__init__(name, bases, attrs)

			# classregistry.register(self, self.interfaces)
			print "Would register class %s now." % self

		def __add__(self, other):
			class AutoClass(self, other):
				pass
			return AutoClass
			# Alternatively, to autogenerate the classname as well as the class:
			# return type(self.__name__ + other.__name__, (self, other), {})

		def unregister(self):
			# classregistry.unregister(self)
			print "Would unregister class %s now." % self

	class MyObject:
		__metaclass__ = MyType


	class NoneSample(MyObject):
		pass

	# Will print "NoneType None"
	print type(NoneSample), repr(NoneSample)

	class Example(MyObject):
		def __init__(self, value):
			self.value = value
		@make_hook
		def add(self, other):
			return self.__class__(self.value + other.value)

	# Will unregister the class
	Example.unregister()

	inst = Example(10)
	# Will fail with an AttributeError
	#inst.unregister()

	print inst + inst
	class Sibling(MyObject):
		pass

	ExampleSibling = Example + Sibling
	# ExampleSibling is now a subclass of both Example and Sibling (with no
	# content of its own) although it will believe it's called 'AutoClass'
	print(ExampleSibling
	print(ExampleSibling.__mro__)


Numpy
------
- How are numpy and pandas related
- numpy arrays

array vs list
	- List
		- list is builtin data structure in python
		- we can either have all elements of same type, or different type
	- array
		- array is available from numpy
		- IN array, we need to have all elements of same type.

	- whenever I have to store all elements of same type, as arrays are more performant than lists, I prefer to use them.

numpy vs pandas
	- numpy is mostly suitable for numerical data computations, whereas
	pandas is suitable for tabular data processing.

	- Numpy is a library that helps you do math with the data, like adding or subtracting numbers.
	Pandas is a library that helps you organize data, like putting it into tables.

- Vectorization
	- Vectorization is the technique of implementing (NumPy) array operations on a dataset.
	In the background, it applies the operations to all the elements of an array or series in one go

Pandas
------
In Pandas,
	I worked on reading csv, excel spreadsheets,
	parsing the content,
	transformations like
		added a new column based on some logic, or
		creating new column based on other columns, or
		cleansing activities like removing null rows, cleaning columns, etc

	finally, dumping the resultant data into csv, excel or, even a db table.

- Data structures, supported by pandas
	- Series - for one-dimensional data
	- dataframe - for two dimensional data

array vs dataframe
	numpy arrays are either single or multiple dimensions
	pandas has two things
		1) Series is 1 dimensional
		2) Dataframe is 2 dimensional

	Indexing of numpy arrays is faster than that of dataframe.

- loc vs iloc
	- loc gets rows (or columns) with particular labels from the index.
	- iloc gets rows (or columns) at particular positions in the index (so it only takes integers).

- dataframe index
	- When index is unique, pandas use a hashtable to map key to value O(1).
	- When index is non-unique and sorted, pandas use binary search O(logN),
	  when index is random ordered pandas need to check all the keys in the index O(N).

	- join vs merge
		- join() is used to combine two DataFrames on the index but not on columns
		- merge() is primarily used to specify the columns you wanted to join on, this also supports
		joining on indexes and combination of index and columns.

- find differences between two dataframes
	df1 = pd.DataFrame({'A':[1,2,3,3],'B':[2,3,4,4]})
	df2 = pd.DataFrame({'A':[1],'B':[2]})

	pd.concat([df1,df2]).drop_duplicates(keep=False)

- Load only the top n rows
    df = pd.read_csv("IMDB Dataset.csv", nrows=100)

- Load n rows from the middle
    df = pd.read_csv("IMDB Dataset.csv", skiprows=range(1,4), nrows=100)

- Convert List to datetime
    pd.to_datetime(pd.Series(s), format='%b_%d')
    pd.to_datetime(pd.Series(s) + '_2015', format='%b_%d_%Y')

- Setting a column as index
    df = df.set_index("column")

- To remove duplicate rows
    based on all columns
        df.drop_duplicates()
    based on specific column
        df.drop_duplicates(subset=['brand'])
    To keep last occurrences,
        df.drop_duplicates(subset=['brand', 'style'], keep='last')


- dataframe to series
- series to dataframe
- uses of series
- vectorization
multi index pandas
- Feature Engineering
	- technique to create  new features from existing data that could help to gain more
	  insight into the data.
	- pandas.apply() for text extraction
	- pandas.groupby() and transform() for Aggregation Features
	- pandas.value_counts() and apply() for Frequency Encoding

- to read specific columns
	df = pd.read_csv("sample_file.csv", usecols=col_list)


Recently, I started working on Polar, which is faster than pandas,
Also supports concurrency too.

Polar syntax is similar to pandas and pyspark, yet it is written in RUST,
So, is extremely fast and support concurrency

- pandas vs pyspark
------------------
	- Pandas run operations on a single machine whereas PySpark runs on multiple machines.
	- Pandas is best suited for small to medium-sized datasets that can fit into memory on a single machine, while PySpark is designed for large-scale data processing on distributed clusters.
	- Pandas provides a wide range of functions for data manipulation and analysis, while PySpark provides a more powerful set of APIs for distributed computing,

- RDD vs dataframe spark
-----------------------
	- RDDs are a low-level data structure with a more flexible schema,
	  while DataFrame is a higher-level data structure with a fixed schema and more efficient processing.
	- DataFrame is generally the preferred data structure in Apache Spark for most data processing tasks, as it provides better performance and a more intuitive API.
	- In terms of
		1) Data Representation:
			- RDD is a lower-level data structure that represents data as an immutable, fault-tolerant collection of elements that can be processed in parallel across a cluster.
			- DataFrame is a higher-level data structure that represents data in a tabular format with named columns, similar to a relational database table.

		2) Schema:
			- RDDs do not have a fixed schema, which means that each record in an RDD can have a different structure.
			- DataFrame has a fixed schema that defines the data types and names of columns, which enables more efficient processing of data.

		3) APIs:
			- RDD provides a low-level API that exposes transformations and actions to perform distributed computing on the data.
			- DataFrame provides a higher-level API that includes built-in operations for filtering, grouping, joining, and aggregating data, making it easier to work with structured data.

		4) Performance:
			- DataFrame is more optimized for query optimization, making it faster and more efficient than RDD for most data processing operations.
			- RDD can be more performant for certain types of operations, such as iterative algorithms or data processing with complex data structures.

- parquet vs deltalake
	- parquet cant handle the slowly changing dimensions, say scd2, which delta lake, we can do better
	- Example, we want to track the address of a person, and if name, address were the only columns,
	   we will loose the history, everytime, we update. so, we need to have start and end date against each row.

	   name, address, startDate, endDate
	   ram,   121	, 21-02-2000, 31-05-2010
	   ram,   121	, 31-05-2010, NULL



- High Performance Computing, in python
	- Dask
		- for distributed computing.
		- facilitates running many computations at the same time, either on a single machine or on many separate computers (cluster).
		- Under the hood, Dask breaks a single large data processing job into many smaller tasks, which are then handled by numpy or pandas
		- https://dask.org/
	- Modin
		- designed to parallelize pandas DataFrames by automatically distributing the
		  computation across all of the system’s available CPU cores.
		- Modin simply divides an existing DataFrame into different parts such that each part can be sent to a different CPU core. And to be more precise, Modin partitions the DataFrames across both rows and columns, which makes its parallel processing highly scalable for DataFrames of any size and shape.

Hadoop
======
HDFS
	- means Hadoop Distributed File System
	- architecture - https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r1.2.1/hdfs_design.html

Hadoop Node types
	1) NameNode
		- It is main node of HDFS; also called master node.
		- It stores meta data in RAM for quick access and track the files across hadoop cluster.
		- If namenode fails, entire HDFC is inaccessible.
		- Namenode tracks all information from files such as
			- which file saved in cluster,
			- access time of file,
			- which user access a file on current time
	2) Secondary Node
		- It helps the primary namenode, and merges the namespaces.
		- It stores data when primary namenode fails, and is used to restart the primary namenode.
		- It requires huge memory for data storing
		- It runs on different machines for memory management;
		- Also, it is checking point of namenode
	3) DataNode
		- It stores actual data of HDFS; also called slave node.
		- No data is affected, even if the data node is failed.
		- As it stores actual data, it is configured with lot of disk space
		- It perform read and write operations as per client request.
		- And, Performance of DataNode are based on NameNode Instuctions.
	4) Checkpoint Node
		- It is designed to address the namenode drawbacks.
		- It tracks the latest checkpoint directory that has same structure.
		- It creates the checking point for NameNode namespace and downloads the edits and fsimage from NameNode and mering locally.
		- The new image are uploaded to NameNode. After this uploads the result to NameNode.
	5) Backup Node
		- It provide the functions to Check Point but it interact with NameNode and it supports the online streaming of filesystems.
		- In Backup Nodes namespace are available on main memory because it interact with primary node.
		- It maintains up-to date file namespace for streaming process.
		- Backup node having own memory so just save and copy the namespace from main memory.
	6) Job Tracker Node
		- Job Tracker node used to MapReduce jobs and it process runs on separate node.
		- It receives the request for MapReduce from client.
		- It Loacte the data when after talking of NameNode.
		- Job tracked choose best TaskTracker for executes the task and it give slots to tasktracker for execute the task.
		- It monitors the all TaskTrackers and give status report to Client.
		- If Job Tracked failure MapReduce function does not executed and all functions are halted so Job Tracker is critical for MapReduce.
	7) Task Tracker Node
		- Task Tracker are runs on DataNode.
		- TaskTrackers will be assigned Mapper and Reducer tasks to execute by JobTracker.
		- If Task Tracker failure the job tracker assign the task for another node so MapReduce Task running successfully..


namenode vs datanode
 - NameNode is the master node in HDFS that manages the file system metadata while
   DataNode is a slave node in HDFS that stores the actual data as instructed by the NameNode.

Datanodes
	- DataNodes are responsible for serving read and write requests from the file system's clients.
	- DataNodes also perform block creation, deletion, and replication upon instruction from the NameNode.

master vs datanode
	- Data nodes store the data, and participate in the cluster's indexing and search capabilities, while
	- master nodes are responsible for managing the cluster's activities and storing the cluster state, including the metadata.

jobtracker vs tasktracker
- JobTracker is the service within Hadoop that is responsible for taking client requests.
- It assigns them to TaskTrackers on DataNodes where the data required is locally present.
- If that is not possible, JobTracker tries to assign the tasks to TaskTrackers within the
  same rack where the data is locally present.

HDFS vs NFs
	- HDFS is a file system where data is distributed among many data nodes
	  so, more reliability, when if one of those systems, was failed.
	- NFS is file system or protocol which allows its clients to access file
	  over the network. All data resides on a single machine. Not much reliable as HDFS.

Ansible
-------
- import vs include
	All import statements are pre-processed at the time playbooks are parsed.
	All include statements are processed as they are encountered during the execution of the playbook.

=======================================================================
Q1) Describe truthy vs falsy
Ans) Python supports boolean type: True, False

bool() -- builtin function which will result the boolean-ness of the object in it.

For integers,
	0 			-> False
	non-zero 	-> True
For floats,
	0.0			-> False
	non-zero	-> True
	0.000001    -> True

For None		-> False

For boolean
	False		-> False
	True 		-> True

For empty collections,
	empty list 	[] 		-> False
	empty tuple () 		-> False
	empty set   set()	-> False
	empty dict 	{}		-> False

	with atleast one element, it is True

For relational and logical operations, based on result
	logical and --> will result in True, if all are True ONLY, else False
	logical OR  --> will result in False, if all are False ONLY, else True

Q2) How do you get the last item of a list?
Ans) we can use the reverse index to retrieve the last element from the list

 Ex: mylist = [23, 45,  6,  3, 23, 65,  2,   4]
			   0   1    2   3   4   5   6     7  <----- forward indexing
			   -8  -7  -6  -5  -4  -3  -2    -1  <------ reverse indexing

	lastnum = mylist[-1]

	Also, we can get indirectly (not preferred) by
		lastNum = mylist[len(mylist) - 1]

Q3) What does a leading _ (underscore) before a variable typically identify in python (used as a common naming convention)?
Ans) Python follows naming convention called name mangling for the variables/methods

	name 	-> Public variable  	- no leading underscores - can be accessed directly
	_name	-> Protected variables  - one leading underscore - can be accessed directly
	__name	-> Private variables 	- two leading underscores - prepend class name as protected variable before it to access
										Ex: _ClassName__name

	__name__ -> built-in variables, or dunder methods, or magic methods
				there are some specific methods, as such.

What is a magic method ( aka dunder method)?
Ans)
These are the builtin methods with some specific usage
As they start and end with two (double) underscores, they were called as dunder (double-underscore) methods.
Examples:
	__init__		constructor method - responsible for added default actions, after creating instance
	__del__			destructor method  - will invoke when deleting the instance
	__new__			method responsible for creating the instance, from a class

	__slot__				will restrict the attributes of class instance

	__enter__ & __exit__ 	used for creating custom context managers

	__iter__ & __next__ 	used for creating custom iterator classes


Also, if we create the class methods with dundermethods like __add__, then
with the instances, instead of addressing with this method names like

	instance1.__add__(instance2)

we can also do as below
	instance1 + instance2


Q4) What was introduced in python 3.6 that changed string formatting?
What do you prefer: f-string or .format()?
Ans)  String formattings in python
	- old style formatting  - using % with the specific data types
		Ex: language = "%s is rank %d language " %("python", 1)


	- new style formatting - using format() with placeholders, and not specific on data types
		Ex: language = "{0} is rank {1} language ".format("python", 1)

	- F-strings (from python 3.6)  -- advanced formatting
		Ex:
			lang = "python"
			rank = 1
			language = f"{lang} is rank {rank} language "

		Also, we can do computations within the braces to do more operations

			language = f"{lang.upper()} is rank {float(rank)} language "

	- F-string assignments ( from python 3.8)
		it will help in the debugging results.
		Instead of
			print("langauge = ", language)
			print("langauge = %s"% language)
			print("langauge = {}".format(language))
			print(f"langauge = {language}")

		we can write as
			print(f"{language =}"

	Finally, among the three (old-style, new-style with format() and f-strings), the
	F-string based formatting with take the least amount of time.

	So, i prefer F-strings among all.

Q5) How to cache data in Python
Ans) It can be done in 3 ways
	 1) Using cache, like
			- functool.lru_cache
			- Memcache
			- or, redis cache
	 2) Using sessions  if is a web application
	 3) Using the database, for persistence

    Also,
		We can import in the __init__.py file in package level and import
		It will be there for the entire session


big data
	mapper - producer
	reduce - receiver

Python Programming
==================
1) Give some examples of data types in python?
Ans)Basic Data types 			- Int, Float, String, None, Bool
	Built-in Data Structures 	- List, Tuple, Set, Dictionary

2) What is the difference between a list and a tuple?
Ans)List is mutable object, means we can edit the object like append, delete, ..
	where as tuple is immutable
	Tuples are faster than lists
		- Tuples are stored in a single block of memory. Tuples are immutable so,
		It doesn't require extra space to store new objects.
		- Lists are allocated in two blocks:
			1. fixed one with all the Python object information, and
			2. variable sized block for the data.
	- USAGE:
		List is used when we need to make changes in code, say adding values while loop .
		Tuple is used when we wont change something in the code

3) When is it a good idea to use a dictionary
Ans)Dictionary is good when there are more reads than writes.
	For reading a key in dict, it is O(1) as keys are unique (hashed and stored).

4) What is a lambda function and why would you use it
Ans)It is a one liner function, mainly useful for evaluating a single expression that is supposed to be evaluated only once.
	- SYNTAX is lambda arguments: expression
	- We need not define a complete function. We can use it instantly for the purpose.
	- It can be passed as a parameter to a higher-order function, like filter(),
	map(), and reduce().
	- example
		- if we have to increment all values in a list by one,
				map(lambda x:x + 1, range(10))
	- And, coming to the con side,
		- It can’t perform multiple expressions.
		- It can easily become cumbersome, for example when it includes an if-elif-else cycle.
		- It can’t contain any variable assignments (e.g., lambda x: x=0 will throw a SyntaxError).
		- We can’t provide a docstring to a lambda function.

5) How to get the last character in a string
Ans) Using the negative index, we can get.
	Ex:word = "Hello"
		last_char = word[-1]

6) What structure do you use to handle an exception (bonus: when does an else block get executed)?
Ans)In Python, exception handling has FOUR blocks. Else and Finally blocks were optional.
	1) Try --- executed every time
	2) Except--- executed when there is exception in try block, check if it can handle break code if it cant
	3) Else--- executed when no exception in try block
	4) Finally-- executed every time— irrespective of failure, it is like for file closing, etc ….

7) What is the difference between a class and an object?
Ans)The instances of class are called objects.
	Class defines the properties and behavior of its instances.
	We can create instances from all classes, except the abstract classes.

8) How would you break apart a comma-delimited list, then put it back together?
Ans) Hoping the question is comma-delimited string. if so,
	Ex: mystr = "a,b,c,d,1,2"
		chars = mystr.split(',') # splits the string to list of chars
		joined = ','.join(chars) # joining the list of strings, to a single string, with again comma as the delimiter

9) How to denote a comment in python?
Ans) Unlike many languages (like java, c++, ...), python dont have multiple comments, as it is an interpreter based language,
where only one line of code is processed by the interpreter each time. Python has only line comments, with # (hash/pound) operator.
It will have its effect from the place it is defined, till the end of that line. This operator will be treated as ordinary character,
if it is part of any string.

10) When would you use the keyword self?
Ans)self acts as a placeholder of the instance, being passed to the class.
	It is not a python keyword, but PEP 8 recommends using it.

11) previous month last date
Ans)
	from datetime import date, timedelta

	curr_month_first_date = date.today().replace(day=1)
	last_month_last_date = curr_month_first_date - timedelta(days=1)
	print(last_month_last_date)

Networking( only answer this if you have experience in this area)
======================================================================
1) Give me an example of a layer 4 protocol
Ans) In the OSI model, layer 4 protocol example include
		UDP - User Datagram Protocol
		TCP - Transmission Control Protocol

2) Give me an example of a layer 7 protocol
Ans)Layer 7 protocol examples include
		HTTP - HyperText Transfer Protocol - for internet communication
		SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol - for email communication

3) There are two parts of an HTTP request the headers and body, what are some examples of headers found in an HTTP request
Ans) A typical HTTP request header contains,
		HTTP Method, URL and HTTP version
		Host 		- server FQDN name
		User-Agent 	- Source (browser or program based) of the request
		Accept 		- What types of data is accepted
		Accept-Language - language of communication
		Accept-Encoding - Types of encoding supported
		Connection	 - connection type - keep-alive or closed
		Cache-Control- If cache present, the age of cache. If default, max-age=0

4) What is the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?
Ans)HTTP with encryption is called HTTPS.
	HTTPS uses TLS (earlier SSL) to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses.
	So, HTTPS is more secure than HTTP.

5) What tool can be used to snoop on network traffic reaching the local machine
Ans) WireShark, TCPDump and WinDump are the most commonly used sniffing tools.
	I worked with wireshark, which gives the .pcap files. I analyzed them programmatically to pull insights.

6) Describe the steps of a TLS handshake (advanced)
Ans) TLS came as a replacement for SSL.
	SSL - Secure Sockets Layer
	TLS - Transport Layer Security

	During the TLS handshake, the client and server together will decide on the TLS version, the cipher which suits both.
	Authenticate the identity of the server via the server's public key and the SSL certificate authority's digital signature.
	Generate session keys in order to use symmetric encryption after the handshake is complete

	The RSA key exchange algorithm is the most common way for the TLS handshake.
	In RSA Key exchange,
		1) Client initiates handshake by sending a hello message, containing
			TLS version the client supports
			cipher suites supported
			string of random bytes, called client random
		2) Server replies with message containing
			the server's SSL certificate,
			the server's chosen cipher suite,
			another string of random bytes, called server random
		3) Client verifies the server's SSL certificate with certificate authority that issued it.
		4) Once verified, the client sends one more random string of bytes, called premaster secret.
		 This premaster secret is encrypted with a public key(which it got from SSL certificate)
		 and can only be decrypted with a private key by the server.
		5) The server decrypts the premaster secret with its private key
		6) Both client and server generate session keys from the client random, server random and the premaster secret.
		 Both results should be the same.
		7) Client sends a "finished" message that is encrypted with a session key.
		8) Server sends a "finished" message encrypted with a session key.
		9) The handshake is completed, and communication continues using the session keys.


Communication/Process
======================
1) Describe your understanding of the scrum process
Ans) It is a project management system. There are two types:
	a) Agile scrum methodology works on incremental development.
			There will be sprint planning, where we plan what to do in the next sprint
			We have a sprint for 2 weeks, in general.
			We have daily standup calls, where we discuss the progress of these jiras, and any blockers.
			At the end of the sprint, we have sprint reviews and retrospective calls.
	b) Kanban
			It is suitable for bug management , mainly.
			Each ticket has a specific weightage and it will go as per this SLA.

2) What is your communication style when chatting on slack
Ans) I will try to explain the point, to avoid ambiguity. For Example, If i am struggling with a problem
	a) I will try to precisely explain the problem
	b) Then, I will list out the different ways of addressing the problem, and corresponding results/failures.
	c) If i have any thoughts, i will ask to suggest among them.

	When someone replies, we will proceed, point-to-point reply

To get only duplicate numbers, in a list
	list1 = [2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2]
	uniques = set()
	dups = []
	for num in list1:
		if num in uniques:
			dups.append(num)
		else:
			uniques.add(num)

	print(dups)

highest - lowest, rearranging a number

	num = 213
	integers = list(str(num))
	highest = int(''.join(sorted(integers, reverse=True)))
	smallest = int("".join(sorted(integers)))
	print(highest - smallest)
