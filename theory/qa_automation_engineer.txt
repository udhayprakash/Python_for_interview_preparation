INTRODUCTION:
I am a QA Automation Developer specializing in Python, with extensive experience in test automation for web, mobile, and API testing. My work is split approximately 70% on test automation development and 30% on test strategy and manual testing.
In Test Automation:

I've developed robust automation frameworks using Python for web, mobile, and API testing.
For web automation, I've extensively used Selenium WebDriver with Python bindings.
In mobile testing, I've worked with Appium for both Android and iOS platforms.
For API testing, I've utilized libraries like requests and pytest-bdd for behavior-driven development.

In Test Frameworks:

I've implemented and maintained Page Object Model (POM) design patterns for better code organization and reusability.
I've worked with test runners like pytest and unittest for executing test suites.
I've integrated reporting tools like Allure and pytest-html for comprehensive test result analysis.

In Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):

I've integrated automated tests with CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, and GitHub Actions.
I've set up automated test execution as part of the deployment process to ensure quality at each release.

In Version Control and Collaboration:

I'm proficient with Git for version control and have experience with collaborative development using GitHub and GitLab.
I've participated in code reviews to maintain code quality and share knowledge within the team.

In Test Data Management:

I've worked with various databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB for test data setup and verification.
I've created data generation scripts and managed test environments to ensure consistent and reliable test execution.

In Performance and Load Testing:

I've used tools like Locust and JMeter to create and execute performance tests.
I've analyzed performance metrics and provided insights for application optimization.

In Test Practices:

I follow test-driven development (TDD) principles, writing tests before implementing features.
I've created comprehensive test plans and test cases, ensuring thorough coverage of application functionalities.
I've performed both functional and non-functional testing, including usability, security, and accessibility testing.

In Collaboration:

I've worked closely with developers, product managers, and other stakeholders to ensure quality throughout the software development lifecycle.
I've participated in Agile ceremonies, contributing to sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives.

For Test Management:

I've used tools like JIRA and TestRail for test case management, defect tracking, and reporting.
