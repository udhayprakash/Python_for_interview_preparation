Market
======
	1) Primary market:
		- A primary market is where new securities are issued for the first time.
		- This is where companies raise capital by selling shares of stock or bonds to investors.

	2) Secondary market:
		- A secondary market is where existing securities are traded between investors.
		- This is where investors can buy and sell shares of stock, bonds, and other securities.

	3) Over-the-counter (OTC) market:
		- An OTC market is a decentralized market where securities are traded directly between two parties.
		- This market is not as regulated as the primary or secondary markets.

	4) Exchange-traded market:
		- An exchange-traded market is a centralized market where securities are traded on an exchange.
		- This market is more regulated than the OTC market.

	5) Futures market:
		- A futures market is a market where contracts for the future delivery of a commodity or financial instrument are traded.
		- This market is used to hedge against price risk or to speculate on future price movements.

	6) Options market:
		- An options market is a market where contracts that give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security at a specified price on or before a specified date are traded.
		- This market is used to hedge against price risk or to speculate on future price movements.


Asset 
=====

		- If the company enters bankruptcy, preferred stockholders are entitled to be paid from company assets before common stockholders.

	3) Callable shares:
		- Callable shares can be redeemed by the company at a specified price.
		- This gives the company the flexibility to repurchase the shares if they become too expensive.

	4) Convertible shares:
		- Convertible shares can be converted into another type of security, such as a bond or a warrant.
		- This gives the holder the flexibility to choose the security that best suits their needs.


	5) Restricted shares:
		- Restricted shares are shares that have certain restrictions on them, such as a lock-up period or a minimum holding period.

	6) Phantom shares:
		- Phantom shares are not real shares, but they give the holder the right to receive the same economic benefits as if they owned real shares.

	7) Exchangeable shares:

	2) Non-voting shares
	3) Preference shares
	4) Redeemable shares


Debt vs Equity
--------------
	 - "Debt" involves borrowing money to be repaid, plus interest, while
	 - "equity" involves raising money by selling interests in the company

Bonds
=====
	- Face value:
		- amount of money that the issuer of the bond agrees to pay back to the bondholder at maturity.

	- Coupon:
		- interest rate that the issuer of the bond agrees to pay to the bondholder.

	- Maturity:
		- date on which the issuer of the bond agrees to pay back the face value of the bond to the bondholder.

	- Yield:
		- return that an investor expects to receive from the bond.
	- yield curve
		- line that plots the interest rates of bonds having equal credit quality but differing maturity dates.
		- The slope of the yield curve gives an idea of future interest rate changes and economic activity.

	- Credit rating:
		- measure of the issuer's ability to repay the bond.

	- duration in bond investing
		- Duration is a measure of a bond's sensitivity to interest rate changes.
		- It indicates how much the price of a bond is likely to change when interest rates move.

	- Default:
		- A default occurs when the issuer of a bond fails to make a payment on the bond.

	- Call option:
		- A call option gives the issuer of a bond the right to repurchase the bond before maturity.

	- Put option:
		- A put option gives the bondholder the right to sell the bond back to the issuer before maturity.

	- Callable bond			: bond that can be repurchased by the issuer before maturity.
	- Convertible bond		: bond that can be converted into shares of stock.
	- Floating-rate bond	        : bond that pays interest that fluctuates with market interest rates.
	- Zero-coupon bond		: bond that does not pay interest until maturity.
	- High-yield bond		: (junk bond), is a bond that is considered to be high-risk.
	- Subordinated bond		: bond that has a lower priority than other types of bonds, such as secured bonds.
	- Inflation-linked bond	        : bond that is linked to the rate of inflation.


Debt Securities
===============
	1) Corporate bonds:
		- Corporate bonds are issued by companies to raise money.
		- They are typically secured by assets of the company, such as buildings or equipment.

	2) Government bonds:
		- Government bonds are issued by governments to raise money.
		- They are considered to be very safe investments, as governments have a strong track record of repaying their debts.

	3) Municipal bonds:
		- Municipal bonds are issued by local governments to raise money.
		- They are typically considered to be a safe investment, as local governments have a strong track record of repaying their debts.

	4) Convertible bonds:
		- Convertible bonds are bonds that can be converted into shares of stock.
		- This gives investors the option to profit from the appreciation of the company's stock.

	5) Floating-rate bonds:
		- Floating-rate bonds are bonds that pay interest that fluctuates with market interest rates.
		- This means that the interest payments on floating-rate bonds may go up or down over time, depending on market conditions.

	6) Zero-coupon bonds:
		- Zero-coupon bonds do not pay interest until maturity.
		- This means that investors do not receive any income from the bonds until they mature.
		- However, zero-coupon bonds typically have a higher yield than bonds that pay interest regularly.

Debentures
==========
	- bondholders will receive a fixed amount of interest each year until the debenture matures.
	- Pros: Potential for higher yield, Longer maturity, Potential for capital appreciation
	- cons: Unsecured, Fixed or floating interest rate, Longer maturity, Higher risk

bonds vs debentures
--------------------
	- Security:
		- Bonds are secured loans, while debentures are unsecured loans.
		- If the company defaults on its debt, bond holders have a claim on company's assets, while debenture holders do not.

	- Issuer:
		- Bonds can be issued by companies, governments, or other entities, while debentures are typically issued by companies.

	- Maturity:
		- Bonds typically have a shorter maturity than debentures.
		- Bond holders get their investment back sooner than debenture holders.

	- Risk:
		- Bonds are typically considered to be less risky than debentures, as bond holders have a claim on the company's assets.

primary market debentures
-------------------------
	- new securities are issued for the first time
	- companies, governments, or other entities issue debentures to raise money.
	- less liquid than the secondary market, as there will be fewer buyers and sellers in the primary market.
	- Features
		Issuer		: company, government, or other entity that is issuing the debenture.
		Underwriter	: The underwriter is the financial institution that is responsible for selling the debentures to investors.
		Pricing		: The price of a debenture is determined by the underwriter based on a number of factors, including the creditworthiness of the issuer, the interest rate environment, and the demand for debentures.
		Proceeds	: The proceeds from the sale of debentures are used by the issuer to raise money.

	- Benefits
		- New issue premium:
			- Investors who buy debentures in the primary market may be able to get a new issue premium, which is a premium above the face value of the debenture.
		- Access to new investment opportunities:
			- The primary market provides investors with access to new investment opportunities that may not be available in the secondary market.
		- Supporting the issuer:
			- By investing in debentures in the primary market, investors are helping to support the issuer and its growth.

	- Risks
		Illiquidity:
			- The primary market for debentures is typically less liquid than the secondary market, which means that it may be difficult to sell debentures in the primary market.
		Risk of default:
			- issuer of a debenture may default on debenture, which means that investors may not be repaid their investment.
		Interest rate risk:
			- If interest rates rise, the value of debentures may fall

role of front desk person for primary market debentures
--------------------------------------------------------
	- to facilitate the issuance of new debentures
	- Providing information to investors about the debentures that are being issued, such as
		- the terms of the debentures,
		- the creditworthiness of the issuer, and
		- the interest rate environment
	- Accepting orders from investors, who want to buy debentures.
	- Processing orders from investors, which includes verifying the identity of the investors, ensuring that the orders are filled, and sending confirmations to the investors.
	- Monitoring the market for debentures, which includes tracking the price of debentures, the demand for debentures, and the creditworthiness of the issuers.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Value at Risk (VaR)
	-  risk management metric/statistical measure that estimates the potential loss in value of an asset or portfolio over a defined period for a given confidence interval. For example, a 1-day 95% VaR of $1 million means there's a 5% chance that the portfolio will lose more than $1 million in a day.
	-  estimates the maximum loss that an investment is likely to experience under normal market conditions over a given time period and with a specified probability

	- WHY VAR
		- It will address questions like:
			1) What can I expect to lose in dollars with a 95% or 99% level of confidence next month?
			2) What is the maximum percentage I can expect to lose with 95% or 99% confidence over the next year?
	- VAR is determined by three variables:
		1) period,
		2) confidence level, and
		3) the size of the possible loss.


	- VaR Modelling
		It determines the potential for loss in the entity being assessed, and the probability of occurrence for the defined loss.
	
	- Methods of Calculating VaR
		1) Parametric (Variance-Covariance) Method: 
			- This method assumes that stock returns are normally distributed.
			- It calculates VaR using standard statistical techniques that are based on the mean (expected return) and standard deviation (volatility) of the investment’s returns.
	
		2) Historical Simulation Method:
			- This method uses historical data to generate a probability distribution.
			- That is, it re-organizes actual historical returns, putting them in order from worst to best. It then assumes that history will repeat itself, from a risk perspective1.
	
		3) Monte Carlo Simulation Method:
			- This method uses computerized mathematical techniques that allow people to account for risk in quantitative analysis and decision making. 
			- It provides a range of possible outcomes and the probabilities they will occur for any choice of action


Risk-Adjusted Return (RAR)
	- calculates the returns earned, relative to the volatility.
	- A steadier return means low volatility and hence a high RAR

	- Formula is
		RAR = CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate) Return on portfolio / Volatility (Standard deviation of returns)

	- For example you will be happier to see a cricketer who scored 50, 50, 60, 40, 50 in 5 is innings in a row rather
	  than one who scores 0, 200, 0, 0, 50 - even though both have the same average.

Gain to Pain ratio:
	- This captures the pain (or the drawdowns) lived through to get the returns.
	- It is defined as the sum of all monthly returns (positive and negative) divided by the sum of the quantum of all monthly negative returns/ drawdowns.

	- Formula is
		Gain to Pain Ratio = Total Returns/ Absolute value of negative returns


Liquidity Management(LM), for Payments
=======================================
 - Practice of managing cash, including assets that can easily be converted to cash
	- Individual
		- Monthly Income, Investments, Outgoing payments
	- Corporations
		- Accounts - Cash, assets
		- Single or multiple currencies
		- Single region or multiple regions or jurisdictions

- Tools for LM
	- Credit Interest
	- Overdraft  - line of credit - shortter - higher interest - given on overnight basis
	- Daylight overdrafts (or) Intraday credit limits
		- Movement of funds in and out of an account - on an intraday basis
	- ZBAs - Zero Balance Accounts
		- Regular current accounts from which the account holder can make/receive payments
		- It's a subaccount created as part of a grouping of accounts, often to segregate different types of payment activity, generally to ease the reconciliation process.
		- Under one Master accounts, there will be multiple ZBAs, created for different types of businesses, of a company
	- Sweep Structures
		- Like ZBA structure, but balance need not be zero at the end of each processing day
		- customer can leave a specified amount in the account that is being 'swept', called a TARGET BALANCE.
		- In auto-sweep, not necessary to move funds from one account to other on daily basis, instead at intervals such as weeky/monthly or at target balance. But customer can make funds movement request outside auto schedule absed on his/her needs.
		- Used by both corporations or individual retail clients
		- Two-way sweep
			- process of moving funds from one account to another and then back again, usually at pre-agreed intervals
	- Notional Pooling
		- surplus balances in one account are OFFSET by overdrawn positions in another account without physically moving funds between accounts
		- Interest is paid/charged on net balance of all accounts in notional pool
		- No Physical movement of funds between accounts
		- Not Allowed in all countries (ex: US, JAPAN only ZBA/Sweep structure)
		- Also, there can be Multi-currency notional pooling
	- POBO (pay on behalf of) & ROBO (receive on behalf of)
		- All of subsidiaries within a legal entity give permission for one enity to make all of its payments and accept all of its receipts.
		- Greter efficiencies for cutomers, leading to cost savings
		- POBO
			- A scheme whereby one legal entity allows another legal entity within a group of companies to make their payments
		- ROBO
			- A scheme whereby one legal entity allows another legal entity within a group of companies to receive their payments


- Strategies for liquidity management may include:

	a. Cash Flow Forecasting:
		- Predicting incoming and outgoing cash flows to anticipate potential shortfalls or surpluses in liquidity.

	b. Cash Reserves:
		- Maintaining a prudent level of cash reserves or cash equivalents to handle unforeseen events or emergencies.

	c. Working Capital Management:
		- Optimizing the management of current assets (e.g., accounts receivable, inventory) and current liabilities (e.g., accounts payable) to ensure smooth operations.

	d. Short-Term Borrowing:
		- Utilizing short-term borrowing facilities, such as lines of credit or overdrafts, to cover temporary cash shortfalls.

	e. Investment of Surplus Funds:
		- Investing excess cash in low-risk, short-term instruments to earn some return while remaining readily available for use.




- Derivative
=============
	a financial instrument whose value depends on (or derives from) the values of other, more basic, underlying variables. Very often the variables underlying derivatives are the prices of traded assets.
	It is a financial security with a value that is reliant upon or derived from, an underlying asset or group of assets. 
	active trading in credit derivatives, electricity derivatives, weather derivatives, and insurance derivatives algorithmic trading (also known as blackbox trading, automated trading, high-frequency trading, or robo trading).
	Common derivatives include futures, forwards, options, and swaps.


open outcry system -> Electronic Trading System 
over-the-counter market
	Trades are done over the phone and are
	usually between two financial institutions or between a financial institution and one of
	its clients (typically a corporate treasurer or fund manager). Financial institutions often
	act as market makers for the more commonly traded instruments. This means that they
	are always prepared to quote both a bid price (a price at which they are prepared to
	buy) and an offer price (a price at which they are prepared to sell).
	Much larger than exchange traded market. 
	
Common Derivatives 
------------------
	- Spot Contract 
		- agreement to buy or sell an asset today

	- Forward Contract
		- agreement to buy or sell an asset at a certain future time for a certain price.
		- Here, buyer will take long position, and selling will take the short position

	- Future contracts 
		- same as forward contracts, but traded in exchange.
		- An agreement to buy or sell a specific asset at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future.
		- Futures are used for hedging or speculating on the price movement of the underlying asset.

		- futures vs forwards
			While both are contracts to exchange an asset at a future date, futures are standardized and traded on exchanges, while forwards are customized and traded over-the-counter.

	- option
		An option is a contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call option) or sell (put option) an underlying asset at a specific price on or before a certain date.
		- Traded both on exchanges and in the over-the-counter market
		types:
			1. call option gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price
			2. put option gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset by a certain date for a certain price.
			
		Price of contract   ---->  exercise price or strike price
		date in the contract---->  expiration date or maturity
		
		American options can be exercised at any time up to the expiration date.
		European options can be exercised only on the expiration date itself
		
		It costs nothing to enter into a forward or futures contract, there is a cost to acquiring an option.
		
		The price of a call option decreases as the strike price increases, while the price of a put option increases as the strike price increases. Both types of option tend to become more valuable as their time to maturity increases
		
		
	participants in options markets:
		1. Buyers of calls
		2. Sellers of calls
		3. Buyers of puts
		4. Sellers of puts

		Buyers are referred to as having long positions; sellers are referred to as having short
		positions. Selling an option is also known as writing the option.

Trader categories
	1. Hedgers use derivatives to reduce the risk that they face from potential future movements in a market variable.
	2. Speculators use them to bet on the future direction of a market variable.
	3. Arbitrageurs take offsetting positions in two or more instruments to lock in a profit.

Hedge Fund
	> What			: An investment to mitigate risk from price fluctuations in the primary investment asset.
	> Why			: To mitigate the risk on underlying asset for farmers and investors.
	> How			: Hedging between underlying asset and corresponding Futures/Options contracts.
	> Prerequisite	: High correlation is required between the hedging instruments.
	> Advantage		: Less investment for mitigation from price uncertainty.

	- Have no regulations, like mutual funds. 
	- This gives them a great deal of freedom to develop sophisticated, unconventional, and proprietary investment strategies.
	- The fees charged by hedge fund managers are dependent on the fund’s performance and are relatively high—typically 1 to 2% of the amount invested plus 20% of the profits.
	
	- Hedge Fund manager uses derivatives to setup a speculative or arbitrage position.
	- For every investment strategy, 
		1. Evaluate the risks to which the fund is exposed
		2. Decide which risks are acceptable and which will be hedged
		3. Devise strategies (usually involving derivatives) to hedge the unacceptable risks.

Strategies Examples
	Long/Short Equities: 
		Purchase securities considered to be undervalued and short those considered to be overvalued in such a way that the exposure to the overall direction of the market is small.
	Convertible Arbitrage:
		Take a long position in a convertible bond combined with an actively managed short position in the underlying equity.
	Distressed Securities:
		Buy securities issued by companies in or close to bankruptcy.
	Emerging Markets:
		Invest in debt and equity of companies in developing or emerging countries and in the debt of the countries themselves.
	Global Macro:
		Carry out trades that reflect anticipated global macroeconomic trends.
	Merger Arbitrage:
		Trade after a merger or acquisition is announced so that a profit is made if the announced deal takes place.

- Black-Scholes model
	Black-Scholes model is a mathematical model used to determine the fair price or theoretical value for a call or put option based on five key variables: stock price, strike price, time until expiration, risk-free rate, and volatility.


- Greeks in options trading
	The Greeks are a set of risk measures used in options trading. They include:
		Delta	: Rate of change in option value per unit change in underlying asset price
		Gamma	: Rate of change in delta per unit change in underlying asset price
		Theta	: Rate of change in option value with respect to time
		Vega	: Rate of change in option value per unit change in volatility

- Portfolio
	A portfolio is a collection of financial assets held by an individual or institution. It may include various types of assets to diversify risk.

	
- Risk in finance
	Risk in finance refers to the possibility that an investment's actual return will differ from the expected return.
	It often implies the potential for financial loss.


- common types of financial risks?

	a) Market Risk		: Risk of losses due to movements in market prices
	b) Credit Risk		: Risk that a borrower will default on debt
	c) Liquidity Risk	: Risk that an asset can't be bought or sold quickly enough
	d) Operational Risk	: Risk of loss due to failed internal processes, people, or systems


- Volatility
	It is a statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. Higher volatility means the price of the asset can change dramatically over a short time period in either direction.


- correlation in finance
	Correlation measures how two securities move in relation to each other. A correlation of 1 means perfect positive correlation, -1 means perfect negative correlation, and 0 means no correlation.


- diversification
	Diversification is a risk management strategy that mixes a variety of investments within a portfolio to reduce the impact of any single investment's performance on the overall portfolio.

- alpha
	Alpha is a measure of an investment's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark index. A positive alpha of 1.0 means the investment has outperformed its benchmark index by 1%.

- beta
	Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the overall market. A beta of 1 indicates that the stock's price moves with the market. A beta greater than 1 is more volatile than the market, while a beta less than 1 is less volatile.

- Sharpe ratio
	Sharpe ratio is a way to examine the performance of an investment by adjusting for its risk. It is the average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility or total risk.

- arbitrage
	Arbitrage is the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset to profit from a difference in the price.
	It exploits short-lived variations in the price of identical or similar financial instruments in different markets or forms.


- leverage
	Leverage refers to the use of borrowed capital to increase the potential return of an investment.
	While it can multiply gains, it can also multiply losses.


- backtesting
	Backtesting is the process of testing a trading strategy or analytical model using historical data to see how accurately the strategy or model would have predicted actual results.


- Portfolio Risk Decomposition
	Its a method of breaking down the total risk of a portfolio into its constituent parts.
	This typically involves analyzing the contribution of each asset or factor to the overall portfolio risk.
	It helps in understanding which elements are driving the portfolio's risk and can assist in risk management and portfolio optimization.


- Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)?
	CAPM is a model that describes the relationship between the expected return of an asset and its risk. It suggests that the expected return of an asset is the risk-free rate plus a risk premium based on the asset's beta.

- Efficient frontier
	It is a set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return.
