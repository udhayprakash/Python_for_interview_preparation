Terraform Experience
======================
I used Terraform to manage infrastructure across AWS Cloud, Azure and Onprime environments
	- Developing modular and reusable Terraform configurations for various infrastructure components like VPCs, EC2 instances, RDS databases, and S3 buckets.
	- Implementing state management strategies, including using remote state storage and state locking to enable team collaboration.
	- Creating CI/CD pipelines for infrastructure deployment, integrating Terraform with tools like Jenkins or GitLab CI.
	- Managing multiple environments (dev, staging, prod) using Terraform workspaces or separate state files.
	- Implementing best practices for security and compliance, including using variables for sensitive information and integrating with secrets management systems.
	- Developing custom Terraform modules to encapsulate complex infrastructure patterns and promote reusability across projects.
	- Troubleshooting and optimizing Terraform configurations, including resolving dependency issues and improving plan/apply performance.

IaaC
====
	- Infrastructure as a Code
	- Provisioning infrastructure through software to achieve consistent and predictable deployments.
	- Benifits
		- Automated deployments
		- Repeatable Processes
		- Consistent environments
		- Reusable Components
		- Documented Architecture
Terraform
	- Infrastructure Automation tool
	- open-source and vendor agnostic
	- Terraform is declarative, Idempotent and consistent
	- we can write in Hashicorp Configuration Language(HCL), or JSON
	- Push based deployment; no agent needed.
	- Has Provider Plugins for 3rd parties like AWS, AZure, etc in registry.terraform.io

Terraform Object Types
	- Providers
		- provides information about the provider(like AWS) which we want to use
	- Resources
		- Each resource is associated with a provider, like EC2, s3, etc.
	- Data Sources
		- They are way to query about anything. they are also associated with providers

- Terraform follows block syntax
	block_type "label" "name_label" {
		key = "value"

		nested_block {
			key = "value"
		}
	}

	resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
		name = "web-server"

		ebs_volume {
			size = 40
		}
	}

Terraform Files
================
	main.tf 			Main configuration file containing resource definition
	variables.tf 		contains variable declaration
	outputs.tf 			contains outputs from resources
	provider.tf 		contains provider definition
	terraform.tfvars	contains all environment variables

variable types - string, number, bool, any, list, map, set, object, tuple
	list -- has all elements of same type
	tuple - has elements of multiple types

Variable definition preference
	1) Environment variables
	2) terraform.tfvars
	3) *.auto.tfvars( alphabetical order)
	4) -var or --var-file (command line flags)
