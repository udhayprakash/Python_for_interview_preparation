MSSQL Employee Promotions

Microsoft SQL version: 12.0

In this MSSQL challenge, your query should identify employees who have a higher salary than their manager. Display each employee's Name, Salary and ManagerName. If the employee does not have a manager, the ManagerName should be displayed as 'No manager'. The result should be ordered by the difference between the employee`s and their manager`s salaries in descending order. Additionally, include column titled PromotionOpportunity that indicates 'YES' if the employee`s salary is higher than their manager`s and 'no' otherwise.

Table Name: maintable_S8A93

﻿1. Employee History Query
Two tables are provided that contains people's names, their current and previous employers. First determine the company or companies that have the highest number of people that were previously employed there. For all of the people who work at one of those companies currently, list the person's name and the name of their previous employer. Results should be in the form people.NAME companies.NAME. The order of the results is not important.
▼Schema
There are 2 tables: PEOPLE, COMPANIES.
PEOPLE table
	ID 				STRING ID of the person.
	NAME 			STRING Name of the person.
	DOJ 			DATE Date of Joining the current company.
	PREV_COMPANY_ID STRING ID of the previous company.
	CURR_COMPANY_ID STRING ID of the current company.

COMPANIES table
	ID STRING ID of the company.
	NAME STRING Name of the company.

Ans)

	SELECT p.NAME, c.NAME
	FROM PEOPLE p
	JOIN COMPANIES c ON p.PREV_COMPANY_ID = c.ID
	WHERE p.CURR_COMPANY_ID IN (
	  SELECT c2.ID
	  FROM COMPANIES c2
	  WHERE c2.NAME = (SELECT c3.NAME FROM COMPANIES c3
					   JOIN PEOPLE p2 ON c3.ID = p2.PREV_COMPANY_ID
					   WHERE c3.NAME = (SELECT c4.NAME
										FROM COMPANIES c4
										JOIN PEOPLE p3 ON c4.ID = p3.PREV_COMPANY_ID
										GROUP BY c4.NAME
										ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
										LIMIT 1)
					   GROUP BY c3.NAME
					   ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
					   LIMIT 1)
	)
=====================================================================================
2. Orders Query

Company X has a record of its customers and their orders.
Find the customer(s) with the highest order price for orders placed within
10 years of the first order (earliest order_date) in the database.
Print the customer name and order price.
If multiple records are returned, they can be in any order.

▼Schema
There are 2 tables: CUSTOMERS, ORDERS.

CUSTOMERS
	ID		STRING ID of the customer. This is the primary key.
	NAME 	STRING Name of the customer.
	ORDER_ID STRING ID of the customer's order.

ORDERS
	ID			STRING ID of the order.
	PRICE		INTEGER Price of the order.
	ORDER_DATE	DATE Date of the order.
Ans)
	SELECT c.NAME, o.PRICE
	FROM CUSTOMERS c
	JOIN ORDERS o ON c.ORDER_ID = o.ID
	WHERE o.ORDER_DATE >= (
	  SELECT MIN(ORDER_DATE)
	  FROM ORDERS
	) AND o.ORDER_DATE <= DATE_ADD((SELECT MIN(ORDER_DATE) FROM ORDERS), INTERVAL 10 YEAR)

Q) What will be the output of when we perform inner join, left outer join, right outer join, full outer join and cross join ob below given tables?
Table1
	Col_1
	1
	1
	1

Table2
	Col_2
	1
	1
	1
Ans)

Inner Join, Left Outer Join, Right Outer Join will give 3 row

	Col_1	Col_2
	1		1
	1		1
	1		1

Full Outer Join: 3*3 = 9 rows
	A full outer join returns all the records from both tables and matching records based on the join condition. Since both tables have the same value in their respective columns, the join will result in all 9 possible combinations of rows from both tables.

	Col_1	Col_2
	1		1
	1		1
	1		1
	1		1
	1		1
	1		1
	1		1
	1		1
	1		1

Cross Join:
	A cross join returns all possible combinations of rows between two tables. Since both tables have only one distinct value in their respective columns, the cross join will result in only one row.

	Col_1	Col_2
	1		1
=====================================================================================
Q) A table wth 3 columns id, name and age

		Where Salary < (select max(Earnings) from EMPLOYEE)

	a) $75,000
	b) $45,000 and $45,001

Q) 	Table name: flight
	Columns: source, destination, dept_time, arrival_time

	Write the query returning all the flights between A to B on a given date, with one layover in between

	SELECT
		f1.source, f1.destination, f1.dept_time, f2.arrival_time
	FROM flight f1
	JOIN flight f2 ON f1.destination = f2.source
	WHERE f1.source = 'A'
	AND f2.destination = 'B'
	AND DATE(f1.dept_time) = '2022-07-21'
	AND f2.dept_time > f1.arrival_time


	To get the layover time between the connecting flights, we can calculate the difference between the arrival time of the first flight (f1) and the departure time of the second flight (f2).

	SELECT
	  f1.source,
	  f1.destination,
	  f1.dept_time,
	  f2.arrival_time,
	  TIMEDIFF(f2.dept_time, f1.arrival_time) AS layover_time

	WHERE
	  f1.source = 'A'

		SELECT
		  t1.id AS id,
		  CASE WHEN t1.id = 2 THEN t2.letter ELSE t1.letter END AS letter
		FROM table1 t1
		JOIN table1 t2 ON t2.id = 5;

	To update changes,

		DECLARE
		  c5_data customers%ROWTYPE;
		  c2_data customers%ROWTYPE;

		BEGIN
		  SELECT * INTO c5_data FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 5;
		  SELECT * INTO c2_data FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 2;

		  -- Swap values
		  UPDATE customers SET
			first_name = c5_data.first_name,
			last_name = c5_data.last_name,
			age = c5_data.age,
			country = c5_data.country
		  WHERE customer_id = 2;

		  UPDATE customers SET
			first_name = c2_data.first_name,
			last_name = c2_data.last_name,

1. Write a SQL query to find the products which does not have sales at all?
	select P.PRODUCT_ID, P.PRODUCT_NAME
	FROM PRODUCTS P
	LEFT JOIN SALES S ON P.PRODUCT_ID = S.PRODUCT_ID
	WHERE S.SALE_ID IS NULL;

2. Write a SQL query to find the products whose sales decreased in 2012 compared to 2011?

	select P.PRODUCT_ID, P.PRODUCT_NAME
	FROM PRODUCTS P
	LEFT JOIN SALES S1 ON P.PRODUCT_ID = S1.PRODUCT_ID AND S1.YEAR= 2011
	LEFT JOIN SALES S2 ON P.PRODUCT_ID = S2.PRODUCT_ID AND S2.YEAR= 2012
	WHERE S1.QUANTITY  > S2.QUANTITY

3. Write a query to select the top product sold in each year?
	select S.YEAR, P.PRODUCT_ID, P.PRODUCT_NAME, MAX(QUANTITY)
	FROM PRODUCTS P
	LEFT JOIN SALES S ON P.PRODUCT_ID = S.PRODUCT_ID
	GROUP BY S.YEAR

4.Write a SQL query to find the products which have continuous increase in sales every year?
	SELECT P.PRODUCT_ID, P.PRODUCT_NAME
	FROM PRODUCTS P
	INNER JOIN SALES S1 ON P.PRODUCT_ID = S1.PRODUCT_ID AND S1.YEAR = 2010
	INNER JOIN SALES S2 ON P.PRODUCT_ID = S2.PRODUCT_ID AND S2.YEAR = 2011 AND S2.QUANTITY > S1.QUANTITY
	INNER JOIN SALES S3 ON P.PRODUCT_ID = S3.PRODUCT_ID AND S3.YEAR = 2012 AND S3.QUANTITY > S2.QUANTITY;
