Purpose: This problem was asked by Amazon.
    There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either
    1 or 2 steps at a time.
    Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways
    you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.

Example:
    if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:
        - 1, 1, 1, 1
        - 2, 1, 1
        - 1, 2, 1
        - 1, 1, 2
        - 2, 2
    What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you
    could climb any number from a set of positive integers X?
    Example: If X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, 5 steps at a time.
